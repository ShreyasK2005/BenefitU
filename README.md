# ABOUT
BenefitU is a web application that helps employees learn more about the benefits they receive from their companies. 

# HOW TO USE
The users of this application enter the company they work in, and if it exists within our DataBase of over 1000+ companies, then you're in good hands.
The user can then ask any questions about the benefits they are entitled to. 
Using the OpenAI API, the user receives detailed feedback on the benefits.
